# Spring Boot + Test-Driven CRUD JDBC 

This simple development project is a showcase contains a domain model [`Customer`](https://github.com/htr3n/spring-jdbc-simple/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/htr3n/springjdbcsimple/data/Customer.java) along with a [`CustomerDao`](https://github.com/htr3n/spring-jdbc-simple/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/htr3n/springjdbcsimple/data/CustomerDao.java) class that accesses the database via JDBC and maps each row to an instance of `Customer`. 

The main goal is to illustrate how Spring JDBC (with `JdbcTemplate` and Spring Boot auto-configuration) works with minimal setting and dependencies.

Most of JDBC functionality are in `CustomerDao` CRUD methods. A test case [`CustomerDaoTest](https://github.com/htr3n/spring-jdbc-simple/blob/master/src/test/java/io/github/htr3n/springjdbcsimple/data/CustomerDaoTest.java)` shows the usage of these CRUD methods.

## Quick Start

Simple execute `mvn clean test` at the command line or with your favorite IDE.
